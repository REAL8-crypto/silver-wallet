# Changelog

All notable changes to the REAL8 Stellar Wallet project will be documented in this file.

## [2.2.8] - 20251009

### Added
- **Liquidity Pool Withdrawal System**
  - Complete withdraw/leave liquidity pool functionality
  - New `LeavePoolDialog` component with intuitive slider interface
  - Percentage-based withdrawal (0-100%) with visual slider controls
  - "Max" button for quick full withdrawal
  - Automatic calculation of proportional asset amounts
  - Real-time display of available pool shares
  - 5% slippage tolerance for withdrawals

- **Enhanced Pool Management UI**
  - "Withdraw" button appears when user has shares in a pool
  - Color-coded buttons: red for withdraw, blue for add/join
  - Side-by-side action buttons for pools with user participation
  - Separate dialogs for deposit and withdrawal operations
  - Auto-refresh pool data after successful operations

- **WalletContext Enhancements**
  - New `leaveLiquidityPool` function for pool withdrawals
  - Automatic minimum amount calculation with slippage protection
  - Pool share validation before withdrawal
  - Proportional asset distribution based on pool reserves
  - Comprehensive error handling and balance checks

### Changed
- **Pool Operation Flow**
  - Split pool operations into dedicated dialogs (join/add vs. withdraw)
  - Improved user feedback with action-specific success messages
  - Enhanced `PoolCard` to show both add and withdraw options
  - Better state management in `PoolsManager` for multiple dialogs

### Fixed
- **Price Calculation for Pool Deposits**
  - Fixed `op_bad_price` error by calculating price from deposit amounts instead of pool reserves
  - Updated price calculation: `exactPrice = maxAmountA / maxAmountB`
  - Reduced slippage tolerance from 15% to 10% (industry standard)
  - Added proper price bounds for `liquidityPoolDeposit` operation

- **Asset Parsing in Pool Operations**
  - Replaced problematic `Asset.fromOperation()` with custom `parseAssetFromReserve()` helper
  - Fixed `e.switch is not a function` error
  - Proper handling of native assets and issued assets from Horizon API
  - Correct parsing of asset strings in format "CODE:ISSUER"

### Technical
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for pool withdrawal operations
- Added `leaveLiquidityPool` to `WalletContextValue` type
- Improved error logging for pool operations with Horizon error details
- Better separation of concerns between join and leave pool workflows
- Proper cleanup of dialog state on open/close

## [2.2.7] - 20251009

### Fixed
- **Liquidity Pool Joining Error**
  - Resolved `REAL8:GBVYY.../XLM does not look like a liquidity pool ID` error in `PoolsManager.tsx` by using `pool.liquidityPoolId` (hexadecimal pool ID) instead of `pool.poolId` (asset pair string) in `joinLiquidityPool` calls.
  - Updated `WalletContext.tsx` to handle both `poolId` (hex) and asset-based inputs for `joinLiquidityPool`, fetching pool by assets if `poolId` is invalid or absent.
  - Removed unnecessary `poolId` prop from `JoinPoolDialog` in `WalletDashboard.tsx`, aligning with `JoinPoolDialogProps` interface.

### Changed
- **Liquidity Pool Handling**
  - Enhanced `joinLiquidityPool` in `WalletContext.tsx` to validate `poolId` as a 64-character hex string or fallback to asset-based pool lookup using `serverRef.current.liquidityPools().forAssets()`.
  - Improved error handling in `PoolsManager.tsx` with better snackbar messages for pool operation failures.
  - Ensured `PoolOperationDialog` in `PoolsManager.tsx` uses correct `liquidityPoolId` from `PoolDef` for consistent pool operations.

### Technical
- Improved TypeScript types in `WalletContext.tsx` for `joinLiquidityPool` parameters to support optional `poolId`.
- Added logging in `joinLiquidityPool` for debugging pool lookup and transaction submission.
- Ensured compatibility between `JoinPoolDialog` (asset-based) and `PoolOperationDialog` (pool ID-based) workflows.

## [2.2.6] - 20251003
